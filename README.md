**This extension is no longer maintained,**

because OpenAI banned my account due to "accessing the API from an [unsupported location](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries)" ðŸ‘Ž

The backend implementation can be found in [mthli/better-youtube-summary-server](https://github.com/mthli/better-youtube-summary-server).

If you want to deploy it yourself, please replace the `bys.mthli.com` with your own domain.
